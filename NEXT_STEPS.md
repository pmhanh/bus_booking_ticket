- Add real email service (SendGrid/SES) for verification + password reset; store reset tokens in Redis with TTL instead of JWT-only token.
- Harden Google OAuth client integration (Google Identity Services button + backend nonce/state) and add GitHub as optional second provider.
- Introduce ticketing domain models (routes, trips, bookings) with migrations, seed scripts, and admin CRUD screens.
- Persist themes/user preferences in DB; add a light theme and toggle control.
- Replace mock dashboard data with live metrics backed by the new domain models; add charts (Recharts/Chart.js).
- Add e2e auth tests (Playwright) and API contract tests; wire CI (GitHub Actions) to run lint + test.
